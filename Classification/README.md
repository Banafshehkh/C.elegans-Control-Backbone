# CLASSIFICATION

There are three classes in this problem. We have Gentle, Harsh, and None class. 
In the Gentle class we have neuronal dynamics of all the neurons as a result of a gentle touch in the sensory neurons (ALM, PLM, AVM).
In the Harsh class we have neuronal dynamics of all the neurons as a result of a harsh touch in the sensory neurons (ALM, AVM, OLQ, ASH, FLP, PVD).
In the None class we have neuronal dynamics of all the neurons as a result of a stimulating a random neuron (HSN, AWC).
About the classification, until now the best classifier has been Random Forest and then Gradient Boosting.

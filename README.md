# C.eleans control backbone and behavioral repertoires

This project includes four steps:
1. Defining and simulating the behaviour
2. Classifying neuronal dynamics associated with the behaviour
3. Systematically destroy the network and determine if it can reproduce these dynamics
4. Select the smallest such network(s).
